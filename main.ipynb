Here’s why:1. Trade War Fears and Market UncertaintyA new wave of tariffs could escalate tensions with key trading partners, particularly the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, leading to retaliatory tariffs and a potential global trade war.Uncertainty in global trade historically increases demand for gold as investors seek a safe haven from market volatility.2. Higher Inflation and Rising CostsTariffs would increase the price of imported cars, leading to higher inflation in the U.S.Rising inflation typically weakens consumer purchasing power and drives investors toward gold, a traditional inflation hedge.3. Economic Slowdown and Risk of RecessionAutomakers and suppliers may cut jobs or reduce production, impacting economic growth.A slowing economy could trigger rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which would lower bond yields and make gold even more attractive as a non-yielding asset.4. Pressure on the U.S. DollarTrade conflicts can destabilize the U.S. dollar, especially if major economies reduce reliance on U.S. exports or retaliate with their own tariffs.A weaker dollar increases the price of gold, as gold becomes cheaper for foreign investors.5. Central Bank Demand and Gold AccumulationIf economic uncertainty rises, central banks may increase gold reserves, further boosting demand.We’ve already seen major central banks accumulating gold at record levels, and new trade disruptions could accelerate this trend.Conclusion: A Strong Bull Case for GoldIf Trump’s 25% auto tariffs take effect, they could trigger inflation, market volatility, and economic slowdown, all of which are bullish for gold. With central banks buying aggressively and rate cuts likely on the horizon, this could be a major buying opportunity for gold traders.Would you buy gold in this scenario?

            "The Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong? for FX:EURUSD by TradingView — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Euro / U.S. DollarEditors' picks2 days agoThe Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong?397Grab this chartGrab this chart17178 979If your trendlines look like a toddler took a crayon to your chart, we need to talk. Or if you draw them so much that your chart looks like a spider web, we still need to talk. Trendlines are one of the most abused, misinterpreted, and downright misused tools in technical analysis. Used correctly, they can give you a structured view of market direction, potential reversals, and areas of interest. Used incorrectly? Well, they can be your fast lane to bad trades, broken accounts, and questioning your life choices.So, are you drawing them wrong? Let’s find out.📞 A Trendline Is Not Your Emotional Support LineThis is big because it happens virtually every day across the charts. When a trade is going south, it’s tempting to adjust your trendline just to make your setup look valid again. That’s not technical analysis—that’s denial. A proper trendline should connect clear pivot highs or lows, not be forcefully manipulated to fit a bias.Traders do this all the time. Price action no longer respects their original line, so they just… move it. As if shifting the goalposts somehow changes reality. It doesn’t. If your trendline gets broken, respect the price action and get out, don’t adjust the line because you risk dragging your account deeper in losses.🤝 Two Points Make a Line—But Three Make It RealHere’s where most traders mess up. They draw a trendline the moment they see two points connecting. Sure, two points technically make a line, but two random highs or lows do not make a valid trend.A legitimate trendline should be tested at least three times to confirm that price actually respects it. Until then, it’s just a hopeful hypothesis. But we gotta give it to the early spotters — yes, if you see two points, pop open a trade and it pans out nicely, then you’ve chomped down on the good grass before the other animals. The more times price touches and respects the trendline, the stronger it is but the risk of it getting overcrowded increases. Anything less than three touches? You’re basically trading off a hunch with a potentially higher risk-reward ratio.⚔️ Wicks, Bodies, or Both? The Great DebateShould you draw trendlines through candle wicks or just use the bodies of the candlesticks? If you’ve spent any time in trading communities, you’ve probably seen this debate get heated enough to break friendships.Here’s the deal:If you’re trading short-term price action, drawing trendlines using candle bodies makes sense because it reflects where most of the market agreed on price.If you’re looking at major trends, wicks matter because they show extreme liquidity zones where prices actually reached before snapping back.⛑️ Steep Trendlines Are a Disaster Waiting to HappenIf your trendline looks more like a vertical cliff than an actual slope, you might want to reconsider its validity. The steeper the trendline, the less reliable it is.A proper trendline should represent a natural flow of zigging and zagging price action. If it’s moving up too aggressively, it’s usually unsustainable. That’s why parabolic runs tend to end with painful crashes—what goes up too fast typically comes down even faster.If your trendline is forming an angle sharper than 45 degrees, be careful. Sustainable trends don’t need a rocket launch trajectory to prove their strength.🌊 One Chart, One Trendline (or Two)—Not TenSome traders draw so many trendlines that their charts get lost under the weight of too many lines. If you need to squint to see price action through the mess of lines, you’re doing too much.Here’s a golden rule in drawing trendlines: less is more. Trendlines should highlight key structures, not overwhelm you with information. If you find yourself drawing trendlines at every minor high and low, take a step back. A clean chart is a tradable chart and one or two trendlines are usually enough to help uncover price direction.🚩 Breakouts Aren’t Always BreakoutsOne of the biggest mistakes traders make is assuming that when the price breaks a trendline, it’s an instant reversal signal. It’s not.Markets (or well-trained algos) love to fake out emotional traders. Just because price dips below your uptrend line doesn’t mean the trend is over—it could just be a temporary pullback or liquidity grab (stop-loss hunting?) before continuing in the original direction.Always wait for confirmation. A proper breakout should come with:Increased volume (to validate the move)Retest of the broken trendline (flipping from support to resistance, or vice versa)Clear follow-through (not just a single candle wick that breaks and snaps back)The market loves tricking traders into premature entries or exits. Don’t fall for it—instead, use some technical backup like looking for a double top, a head and shoulders or some other popular chart pattern.☝️ The Only Trendline That Matters? The One The Market RespectsAt the end of the day, trendlines are just tools—guides to help you structure price action. They’re not magical indicators. They don’t necessarily predict the future. They simply help visualize market tendencies.If price constantly breaks through your trendline and ignores it, guess what? It’s not a valid trendline. The best traders don’t force a narrative—they adjust their view based on what the price is actually doing.So next time you find yourself drawing, adjusting, or forcing trendlines into existence, ask yourself: Am I analyzing the market, or just trying to make myself feel better? Because the market isn’t wrong—so better check your trendlines twice.Now off to you—are you using trendlines in your charts and do you wait for the third point to connect before moving in?

It covers key parameters like anchor type, regression length, bias, and signal criteria—essential for aligning the tool with your trading strategy.█ Key Features:⯁ Multi-Regression Capability:Plot up to three distinct regression channels and/or bands simultaneously, each with customizable anchor types to define their length.⯁ Regression & Deviation Methods:Regressions Types:Standard: Uses ordinary least squares to compute a simple linear trend by averaging the data and deriving a slope and endpoints over the lookback period.Ridge: Introduces L2 regularization to stabilize the slope by penalizing large coefficients, which helps mitigate multicollinearity in the data.Lasso: Uses L1 regularization through soft-thresholding to shrink less important coefficients, yielding a simpler model that highlights key trends.Elastic Net: Combines L1 and L2 penalties to balance coefficient shrinkage and selection, producing a robust weighted slope that handles redundant predictors.Huber: Implements the Huber loss with iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) and EMA-style weights to reduce the impact of outliers while estimating the slope.Least Absolute Deviations (LAD): Reduces absolute errors using iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), yielding a slope less sensitive to outliers than squared-error methods.Bayesian Linear: Merges prior beliefs with weighted data through Bayesian updating, balancing the prior slope with data evidence to derive a probabilistic trend.Deviation Types:Regressive Linear (Reverse): In reverse order (recent to oldest), compute weighted squared differences between the data and a line defined by a starting value and slope.Progressive Linear (Forward): In forward order (oldest to recent), compute weighted squared differences between the data and a line defined by a starting value and slope.Balanced Linear: In forward order (oldest to newest), compute regression, then pair to source data in reverse order (newest to oldest) to compute weighted squared differences.Mean Absolute: Compute weighted absolute differences between each data point and its regression line value, then aggregate them to yield an average deviation.Median Absolute: Determine the weighted median of the absolute differences between each data point and its regression line value to capture the central tendency of deviations.Percent: Compute deviation as a percentage of a base value by multiplying that base by the specified percentage, yielding symmetric positive and negative deviations.Fitted: Compare a regression line with high and low series values by computing weighted differences to determine the maximum upward and downward deviations.Average True Range: Iteratively compute the weighted average of absolute differences between the data and its regression line to yield an ATR-style deviation measure.Bias:Bias: Applies EMA or inverse-EMA style weighting to both Regression and/or Deviation, emphasizing either recent or older data.⯁ Customizable Regression Length via Anchors:Anchor Types:Fixed: Length. Bar-Based: Bar Highest/Lowest, Volume Highest/Lowest, Spread Highest/Lowest.Correlation: R Zero, R Highest, R Lowest, R Absolute.Slope: Slope Zero, Slope Highest, Slope Lowest, Slope Absolute.Indicator-Based: Indicators Highest/Lowest (ADX, ATR, BBW, CCI, MACD, RSI, Stoch).Time-Based: Time (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year, Decade, Custom).Session-Based: Session (Tokyo, London, New York, Sydney, Custom).Event-Based: Earnings, Dividends, Splits. External: Input Source Highest/Lowest.Length Selection:Maximum: The highest allowed regression length (also fixed value of “Length” anchor).Minimum: The shortest allowed length, ensuring enough bars for a valid regression.Step: The sampling interval (e.g., 1 checks every bar, 2 checks every other bar, etc.). Increasing the step reduces the loading time, most applicable to “Slope” and “R” anchors.Adaptive lookback: Adaptive Lookback: Enable to display regression regardless of too few historical bars.⯁ Selecting Bias:Bias applies separately to regression and deviation.Positive values emphasize recent data (EMA-style), negative invert, and near-zero maintains balance. (e.g., a length 100, bias +1 gives the newest price ~7× more weight than the oldest).It's best to apply bias to both (regression and deviation) or just the deviation. Biasing only regression may distort deviation visually, while biasing both keeps their relationship intuitive. Using bias only for deviation scales it without altering regression, offering unique analysis.⯁ Scale Awareness:Supports linear and logarithmic price scaling, the regression and deviations adjust accordingly.⯁ Signal Generation & Alerts:Customizable entry/exit signals and alerts, detailed in the dedicated section below.⯁ Visual Enhancements & Real-World Examples:Optional on-chart table display summarizing regression input criteria (display type, anchor type, source, regression type, regression bias, deviation type, deviation bias, deviation multiplier) and key calculated metrics (regression length, slope, Pearson’s R, percentage position within deviations, etc.) for quick reference.█ Understanding R (Pearson Correlation Coefficient):Pearson’s R gauges data alignment to a straight-line trend within the regression length:Range: R varies between –1 and +1. R = +1 → Perfect positive correlation (strong uptrend). R = 0 → No linear relationship detected. R = –1 → Perfect negative correlation (strong downtrend). This script uses Pearson’s R as an anchor, adjusting regression length to target specific R traits. Strong R (±1) follows the regression channel, while weak R (0) shows inconsistency.█ Understanding the Slope:The slope is the direction and rate at which the regression line rises or falls per bar:Positive Slope (>0): Uptrend – Steeper means faster increase.Negative Slope (<0): Downtrend – Steeper means sharper drop. Zero or Near-Zero Slope: Sideways – Indicating range-bound conditions.This script uses highest and lowest slope as an anchor, where extremes highlight strong moves and trend lines, while values near zero indicate sideways action and possible support/resistance.█ Setup & Configuration:Whether you’re new to this script or want to quickly adjust all critical parameters, the panel below shows the main settings available. You can customize everything from the anchor type and maximum length to the bias, signal conditions, and more.Scale (select Log Scale for logarithmic, otherwise linear scale).Display (regression channel and/or bands).Anchor (how regression length is determined).Length (control bars analyzed):• Max – Upper limit.• Min – Prevents regression from becoming too short.• Step – Controls scanning precision; increasing Step reduces load time.Regression:• Type – Calculation method.• Bias – EMA-style emphasis (>0=new bars weighted more; <0=old bars weighted more).Deviation:• Type – Calculation method.• Bias – EMA-style emphasis (>0=new bars weighted more; <0=old bars weighted more).• Multiplier - Adjusts Upper and Lower Deviation.Signal Criteria:• % (Price vs Deviation) – (0% = lower deviation, 50% = regression, 100% = upper deviation).• R – (0 = no correlation, ±1 = perfect correlation; >0 = +slope, <0 = -slope).Table (analyze table of input settings, calculated results, and signal criteria).Adaptive Lookback (display regression while too few historical bars).Multiple Regressions (steps 2 to 7 apply to #1, #2, and #3 regressions).█ Signal Generation & Alerts:The script offers customizable entry and exit signals with flexible criteria and visual cues (background color, dots, or triangles). Alerts can also be triggered for these opportunities.Percent Direction Criteria:(0% = lower deviation, 50% = regression line, 100% = upper deviation)Above %: Triggers if price is above a specified percent of the deviation channel.Below %: Triggers if price is below a specified percent of the deviation channel.(Blank): Ignores the percent‐based condition.Pearson's R (Correlation) Direction Criteria:(0 = no correlation, ±1 = perfect correlation; >0 = positive slope, <0 = negative slope)Above R / Below R: Compares the correlation to a threshold. Above│R│ / Below│R│: Uses absolute correlation to focus on strength, ignoring direction.Zero to R: Checks if R is in the 0-to-threshold range. (Blank): Ignores correlation-based conditions. █ User Tips & Best Practices:Choose an anchor type that suits your strategy, “Bar Highest/Lowest” automatically spots commonly used regression zones, while “│R│ Highest” targets strong linear trends.Consider enabling or disabling the Adaptive Lookback feature to ensure you always have a plotted regression if your chart doesn’t meet the maximum-length requirement.Use a small Step size (1) unless relying on R-correlation or slope-based anchors as the are time-consuming to calculate. Larger steps speed up calculations but reduce precision.Fine-tune settings such as lookback periods, regression bias, and deviation multipliers, or trend strength. Small adjustments can significantly affect how channels and signals behave.To reduce loading time, show only channels (not bands) and disable signals, this limits calculations to the last bar and supports more extreme criteria.Use the table display to monitor anchor type, calculated length, slope, R value, and percent location at a glance—especially if you have multiple regressions visible simultaneously.█ Conclusion:With its blend of advanced regression techniques, flexible deviation options, and a wide range of anchor types, this indicator offers a highly adaptable linear regression channeling system. Whether you're anchoring to time, price extremes, correlation, slope, or external events, the tool can be shaped to fit a variety of strategies. Combined with customizable signals and alerts, it may help highlight areas of confluence and support a more structured approach to identifying potential opportunities.13 hours agoRelease Notes- Anchor can now be set to regression source (highest/lowest).- Improved regression plotting for sources with different data availability dates than chart.- Table now includes Avgerage Absolute R, and count of occurrences above/below regression.- Minor changes.Open-source scriptIn true TradingView spirit, the creator of this script has made it open-source, so that traders can review and verify its functionality.

Small adjustments can significantly affect how channels and signals behave.To reduce loading time, show only channels (not bands) and disable signals, this limits calculations to the last bar and supports more extreme criteria.Use the table display to monitor anchor type, calculated length, slope, R value, and percent location at a glance—especially if you have multiple regressions visible simultaneously.█ Conclusion:With its blend of advanced regression techniques, flexible deviation options, and a wide range of anchor types, this indicator offers a highly adaptable linear regression channeling system. Whether you're anchoring to time, price extremes, correlation, slope, or external events, the tool can be shaped to fit a variety of strategies. Combined with customizable signals and alerts, it may help highlight areas of confluence and support a more structured approach to identifying potential opportunities.13 hours agoRelease Notes- Anchor can now be set to regression source (highest/lowest).- Improved regression plotting for sources with different data availability dates than chart.- Table now includes Avgerage Absolute R, and count of occurrences above/below regression.- Minor changes.Open-source scriptIn true TradingView spirit, the creator of this script has made it open-source, so that traders can review and verify its functionality.

            "TASC 2025.04 The Ultimate Oscillator — Indicator by PineCodersTASC — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksOPEN-SOURCE SCRIPTMar 19TASC 2025.04 The Ultimate OscillatorChartSource codeMoreAdd to favoritesAdd to favoritesUse on chart157553 509█ OVERVIEWThis script implements an alternative, refined version of the Ultimate Oscillator (UO) designed to reduce lag and enhance responsiveness in momentum indicators, as introduced by John F. Ehlers in his article \"Less Lag In Momentum Indicators, The Ultimate Oscillator\" from the April 2025 edition of TASC's Traders' Tips.█ CONCEPTSIn his article, Ehlers states that indicators are essentially filters that remove unwanted noise (i.e., unnecessary information) from market data. Simply put, they process a series of data to place focus on specific information, providing a different perspective on price dynamics. Various filter types attenuate different periodic signals within the data. For instance, a lowpass filter allows only low-frequency signals, a highpass filter allows only high-frequency signals, and a bandpass filter allows signals within a specific frequency range. Ehlers explains that the key to removing indicator lag is to combine filters of different types in such a way that the result preserves necessary, useful signals while minimizing delay (lag). His proposed UltimateOscillator aims to maintain responsiveness to a specific frequency range by measuring the difference between two highpass filters' outputs. The oscillator uses the following formula:UO = (HP1 - HP2) / RMSWhere:HP1 is the first highpass filter. HP2 is another highpass filter that allows only shorter wavelengths than the critical period of HP1.RMS is the root mean square of the highpass filter difference, used as a scaling factor to standardize the output. The resulting oscillator is similar to a bandpass filter, because it emphasizes wavelengths between the critical periods of the two highpass filters. Ehlers' UO responds quickly to value changes in a series, providing a responsive view of momentum with little to no lag. █ USAGEEhlers' UltimateOscillator sets the critical periods of its highpass filters using two parameters: BandEdge and Bandwidth: The BandEdge sets the critical period of the second highpass filter, which determines the shortest wavelengths in the response. The Bandwidth is a multiple of the BandEdge used for the critical period of the first highpass filter, which determines the longest wavelengths in the response. Ehlers suggests that a Bandwidth value of 2 works well for most applications. However, traders can use any value above or equal to 1.4. Users can customize these parameters with the \"Bandwidth\" and \"BandEdge\" inputs in the \"Settings/Inputs\" tab. The script plots the UO calculated for the specified \"Source\" series in a separate pane, with a color based on the chart's foreground color. Positive UO values indicate upward momentum or trends, and negative UO values indicate the opposite. Additionally, this indicator provides the option to display a \"cloud\" from 10 additional UO series with different settings for an aggregate view of momentum. The \"Cloud\" input offers four display choices: \"Bandwidth\", \"BandEdge\", \"Bandwidth + BandEdge\", or \"None\".The \"Bandwidth\" option calculates oscillators with different Bandwidth values based on the main oscillator's setting. Likewise, the \"BandEdge\" option calculates oscillators with varying BandEdge values. The \"Bandwidth + BandEdge\" option calculates the extra oscillators with different values for both parameters. When a user selects any of these options, the script plots the maximum and minimum oscillator values and fills their space with a color gradient. The fill color corresponds to the net sum of each UO's sign, indicating whether most of the UOs reflect positive or negative momentum. Green hues mean most oscillators are above zero, signifying stronger upward momentum. Red hues mean most are below zero, indicating stronger downward momentum.

            "real_time_candles — Library by The_Peaceful_Lizard — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksPINE LIBRARYUpdated Mar 19real_time_candlesChartSource codeMore191242410 205Mar 16IntroductionThe Real-Time Candles Library provides comprehensive tools for creating, manipulating, and visualizing custom timeframe candles in Pine Script. Unlike standard indicators that only update at bar close, this library enables real-time visualization of price action and indicators within the current bar, offering traders unprecedented insight into market dynamics as they unfold.This library addresses a fundamental limitation in traditional technical analysis: the inability to see how indicators evolve between bar closes. By implementing sophisticated real-time data processing techniques, traders can now observe indicator movements, divergences, and trend changes as they develop, potentially identifying trading opportunities much earlier than with conventional approaches.Key FeaturesThe library supports two primary candle generation approaches:Chart-Time Candles: Generate real-time OHLC data for any variable (like RSI, MACD, etc.) while maintaining synchronization with chart bars.Custom Timeframe (CTF) Candles: Create candles with custom time intervals or tick counts completely independent of the chart's native timeframe.Both approaches support traditional candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization styles, with options for moving average overlays to smooth the data.Configuration RequirementsFor optimal performance with this library:Set max_bars_back = 5000 in your script settingsWhen using CTF drawing functions, set max_lines_count = 500, max_boxes_count = 500, and max_labels_count = 500These settings ensure that you will be able to draw correctly and will avoid any runtime errors.Usage ExamplesBasic Chart-Time Candle VisualizationPine Script®// Create real-time candles for RSI float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) Candle rsi_candle = candle_series(rsi, CandleType.candlestick) // Plot the candles using Pine's built-in function plotcandle(rsi_candle.Open, rsi_candle.High, rsi_candle.Low, rsi_candle.Close, \"RSI Candles\", rsi_candle.candle_color, rsi_candle.candle_color)Expand 2 linesMultiple Access PatternsThe library provides three ways to access candle data, accommodating different programming styles:Pine Script®// 1. Array-based access for collection operations Candle[] candles = candle_array(source) // 2. Object-oriented access for single entity manipulation Candle candle = candle_series(source) float value = candle.source(Source.HLC3) // 3. Tuple-based access for functional programming styles [open, high, low, close] = candle_tuple(source)Expand 4 linesCustom Timeframe ExamplesPine Script®// Create 20-second candles with EMA overlay plot_ctf_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 20, timezone = -5, tied_open = true, ema_period = 9, enable_ema = true ) // Create tick-based candles (new candle every 15 ticks) plot_ctf_tick_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.heikin_ashi, number_of_ticks = 15, timezone = -5, tied_open = true )Expand 15 linesAdvanced Usage with Custom VisualizationPine Script®// Get custom timeframe candles without automatic plotting CandleCTF[] my_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 30 ) // Apply custom logic to the candles float[] ema_values = my_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Draw candles and EMA using time-based coordinates my_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() ema_values.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = #FF6D00)Expand 9 linesLibrary ComponentsData TypesCandle: Structure representing chart-time candles with OHLC, polarity, and visualization propertiesCandleCTF: Extended candle structure with additional time metadata for custom timeframesTickData: Structure for individual price updates with time deltasEnumerationsCandleType: Specifies visualization style (candlestick or Heikin-Ashi)Source: Defines price components for calculations (Open, High, Low, Close, HL2, etc.)SampleType: Sets sampling method (Time-based or Tick-based)Core Functionsget_tick(): Captures current price as a tick data pointcandle_array(): Creates an array of candles from price updatescandle_series(): Provides a single candle based on latest datacandle_tuple(): Returns OHLC values as a tuplectf_candles_array(): Creates custom timeframe candles without renderingVisualization Functionssource(): Extracts specific price components from candlescandle_ctf_to_float(): Converts candle data to float arraysctf_ema(): Calculates exponential moving averages for candle arraysdraw_ctf_candles_time(): Renders candles using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_candles_index(): Renders candles using bar index coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_time(): Renders lines using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_index(): Renders lines using bar index coordinatesTechnical Implementation NotesThis library leverages Pine Script's varip variables for state management, creating a sophisticated real-time data processing system. The implementation includes:Efficient tick capturing: Samples price at every execution, maintaining temporal tracking with time deltasSmart state management: Uses a hybrid approach with mutable updates at index 0 and historical preservation at index 1+Temporal synchronization: Manages two time domains (chart time and custom timeframe)The tooltip implementation provides crucial temporal context for custom timeframe visualizations, allowing users to understand exactly when each candle formed regardless of chart timeframe.LimitationsCustom timeframe candles cannot be backtested due to Pine Script's limitations with historical tick dataReal-time visualization is only available during live chart updatesMaximum history is constrained by Pine Script's array size limitsApplicationsIndicator visualization: See how RSI, MACD, or other indicators evolve in real-timeVolume analysis: Create custom volume profiles independent of chart timeframeScalping strategies: Identify short-term patterns with precisely defined time windowsVolatility measurement: Track price movement characteristics within barsCustom signal generation: Create entry/exit signals based on custom timeframe patternsConclusionThe Real-Time Candles Library bridges the gap between traditional technical analysis (based on discrete OHLC bars) and the continuous nature of market movement. By making indicators more responsive to real-time price action, it gives traders a significant edge in timing and decision-making, particularly in fast-moving markets where waiting for bar close could mean missing important opportunities.Whether you're building custom indicators, researching price patterns, or developing trading strategies, this library provides the foundation for sophisticated real-time analysis in Pine Script.Implementation Details & Advanced GuideCore Implementation ConceptsThe Real-Time Candles Library implements a sophisticated event-driven architecture within Pine Script's constraints. At its heart, the library creates what's essentially a reactive programming framework handling continuous data streams.Tick Processing SystemThe foundation of the library is the get_tick() function, which captures price updates as they occur:Pine Script®export get_tick(series float source = close, series float na_replace = na)=> varip float price = na varip int series_index = -1 varip int old_time = 0 varip int new_time = na varip float time_delta = 0 // ...Expand 2 linesThis function:Samples the current priceCalculates time elapsed since last updateMaintains a sequential index to track updatesThe resulting TickData structure serves as the fundamental building block for all candle generation.State Management ArchitectureThe library employs a sophisticated state management system using varip variables, which persist across executions within the same bar. This creates a hybrid programming paradigm that's different from standard Pine Script's bar-by-bar model.For chart-time candles, the core state transition logic is:Pine Script®// Real-time update of current candle candle_data := Candle.new(Open, High, Low, Close, polarity, series_index, candle_color) candles.set(0, candle_data) // When a new bar starts, preserve the previous candle if clear_state candles.insert(1, candle_data) price.clear() // Reset state for new candle Open := Close price.push(Open) series_index += 1Expand 7 linesThis pattern of updating index 0 in real-time while inserting completed candles at index 1 creates an elegant solution for maintaining both current state and historical data.Custom Timeframe ImplementationThe custom timeframe system manages its own time boundaries independent of chart bars:Pine Script®bool clear_state = switch settings.sample_type SampleType.Ticks => cumulative_series_idx >= settings.number_of_ticks SampleType.Time => cumulative_time_delta >= settings.number_of_secondsThis dual-clock system synchronizes two time domains:Pine's execution clock (bar-by-bar processing)The custom timeframe clock (tick or time-based)The library carefully handles temporal discontinuities, ensuring candle formation remains accurate despite irregular tick arrival or market gaps.Advanced Usage Techniques1. Creating Custom Indicators with Real-Time CandlesTo develop indicators that process real-time data within the current bar:Pine Script®// Get real-time candles for your data Candle[] rsi_candles = candle_array(ta.rsi(close, 14)) // Calculate indicator values based on candle properties float signal = ta.ema(rsi_candles.first().source(Source.Close), 9) // Detect patterns that occur within the bar bool divergence = close > close[1] and rsi_candles.first().Close < rsi_candles.get(1).CloseExpand 3 lines2. Working with Custom Timeframes and PlottingFor maximum flexibility when visualizing custom timeframe data:Pine Script®// Create custom timeframe candles CandleCTF[] volume_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = volume, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 60 ) // Convert specific candle properties to float arrays float[] volume_closes = volume_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) // Calculate derived values float[] volume_ema = volume_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Create custom visualization volume_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() volume_ema.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = color.orange)Expand 12 lines3. Creating Hybrid Timeframe AnalysisOne powerful application is comparing indicators across multiple timeframes:Pine Script®// Standard chart timeframe RSI float chart_rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) // Custom 5-second timeframe RSI CandleCTF[] ctf_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 5 ) float[] fast_rsi_array = ctf_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) float fast_rsi = fast_rsi_array.first() // Generate signals based on divergence between timeframes bool entry_signal = chart_rsi < 30 and fast_rsi > fast_rsi_array.get(1)Expand 10 linesFinal NotesThis library represents an advanced implementation of real-time data processing within Pine Script's constraints. By creating a reactive programming framework for handling continuous data streams, it enables sophisticated analysis typically only available in dedicated trading platforms.The design principles employed—including state management, temporal processing, and object-oriented architecture—can serve as patterns for other advanced Pine Script development beyond this specific application.------------------------Library \"real_time_candles\"A comprehensive library for creating real-time candles with customizable timeframes and sampling methods.Supports both chart-time and custom-time candles with options for candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization.Allows for tick-based or time-based sampling with moving average overlay capabilities.get_tick(source, na_replace) Captures the current price as a tick data point Parameters: source (float): Optional -

            "real_time_candles — Library by The_Peaceful_Lizard — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksPINE LIBRARYUpdated Mar 19real_time_candlesChartSource codeMore191242410 205Mar 16IntroductionThe Real-Time Candles Library provides comprehensive tools for creating, manipulating, and visualizing custom timeframe candles in Pine Script. Unlike standard indicators that only update at bar close, this library enables real-time visualization of price action and indicators within the current bar, offering traders unprecedented insight into market dynamics as they unfold.This library addresses a fundamental limitation in traditional technical analysis: the inability to see how indicators evolve between bar closes. By implementing sophisticated real-time data processing techniques, traders can now observe indicator movements, divergences, and trend changes as they develop, potentially identifying trading opportunities much earlier than with conventional approaches.Key FeaturesThe library supports two primary candle generation approaches:Chart-Time Candles: Generate real-time OHLC data for any variable (like RSI, MACD, etc.) while maintaining synchronization with chart bars.Custom Timeframe (CTF) Candles: Create candles with custom time intervals or tick counts completely independent of the chart's native timeframe.Both approaches support traditional candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization styles, with options for moving average overlays to smooth the data.Configuration RequirementsFor optimal performance with this library:Set max_bars_back = 5000 in your script settingsWhen using CTF drawing functions, set max_lines_count = 500, max_boxes_count = 500, and max_labels_count = 500These settings ensure that you will be able to draw correctly and will avoid any runtime errors.Usage ExamplesBasic Chart-Time Candle VisualizationPine Script®// Create real-time candles for RSI float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) Candle rsi_candle = candle_series(rsi, CandleType.candlestick) // Plot the candles using Pine's built-in function plotcandle(rsi_candle.Open, rsi_candle.High, rsi_candle.Low, rsi_candle.Close, \"RSI Candles\", rsi_candle.candle_color, rsi_candle.candle_color)Expand 2 linesMultiple Access PatternsThe library provides three ways to access candle data, accommodating different programming styles:Pine Script®// 1. Array-based access for collection operations Candle[] candles = candle_array(source) // 2. Object-oriented access for single entity manipulation Candle candle = candle_series(source) float value = candle.source(Source.HLC3) // 3. Tuple-based access for functional programming styles [open, high, low, close] = candle_tuple(source)Expand 4 linesCustom Timeframe ExamplesPine Script®// Create 20-second candles with EMA overlay plot_ctf_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 20, timezone = -5, tied_open = true, ema_period = 9, enable_ema = true ) // Create tick-based candles (new candle every 15 ticks) plot_ctf_tick_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.heikin_ashi, number_of_ticks = 15, timezone = -5, tied_open = true )Expand 15 linesAdvanced Usage with Custom VisualizationPine Script®// Get custom timeframe candles without automatic plotting CandleCTF[] my_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 30 ) // Apply custom logic to the candles float[] ema_values = my_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Draw candles and EMA using time-based coordinates my_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() ema_values.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = #FF6D00)Expand 9 linesLibrary ComponentsData TypesCandle: Structure representing chart-time candles with OHLC, polarity, and visualization propertiesCandleCTF: Extended candle structure with additional time metadata for custom timeframesTickData: Structure for individual price updates with time deltasEnumerationsCandleType: Specifies visualization style (candlestick or Heikin-Ashi)Source: Defines price components for calculations (Open, High, Low, Close, HL2, etc.)SampleType: Sets sampling method (Time-based or Tick-based)Core Functionsget_tick(): Captures current price as a tick data pointcandle_array(): Creates an array of candles from price updatescandle_series(): Provides a single candle based on latest datacandle_tuple(): Returns OHLC values as a tuplectf_candles_array(): Creates custom timeframe candles without renderingVisualization Functionssource(): Extracts specific price components from candlescandle_ctf_to_float(): Converts candle data to float arraysctf_ema(): Calculates exponential moving averages for candle arraysdraw_ctf_candles_time(): Renders candles using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_candles_index(): Renders candles using bar index coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_time(): Renders lines using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_index(): Renders lines using bar index coordinatesTechnical Implementation NotesThis library leverages Pine Script's varip variables for state management, creating a sophisticated real-time data processing system. The implementation includes:Efficient tick capturing: Samples price at every execution, maintaining temporal tracking with time deltasSmart state management: Uses a hybrid approach with mutable updates at index 0 and historical preservation at index 1+Temporal synchronization: Manages two time domains (chart time and custom timeframe)The tooltip implementation provides crucial temporal context for custom timeframe visualizations, allowing users to understand exactly when each candle formed regardless of chart timeframe.LimitationsCustom timeframe candles cannot be backtested due to Pine Script's limitations with historical tick dataReal-time visualization is only available during live chart updatesMaximum history is constrained by Pine Script's array size limitsApplicationsIndicator visualization: See how RSI, MACD, or other indicators evolve in real-timeVolume analysis: Create custom volume profiles independent of chart timeframeScalping strategies: Identify short-term patterns with precisely defined time windowsVolatility measurement: Track price movement characteristics within barsCustom signal generation: Create entry/exit signals based on custom timeframe patternsConclusionThe Real-Time Candles Library bridges the gap between traditional technical analysis (based on discrete OHLC bars) and the continuous nature of market movement. By making indicators more responsive to real-time price action, it gives traders a significant edge in timing and decision-making, particularly in fast-moving markets where waiting for bar close could mean missing important opportunities.Whether you're building custom indicators, researching price patterns, or developing trading strategies, this library provides the foundation for sophisticated real-time analysis in Pine Script.Implementation Details & Advanced GuideCore Implementation ConceptsThe Real-Time Candles Library implements a sophisticated event-driven architecture within Pine Script's constraints. At its heart, the library creates what's essentially a reactive programming framework handling continuous data streams.Tick Processing SystemThe foundation of the library is the get_tick() function, which captures price updates as they occur:Pine Script®export get_tick(series float source = close, series float na_replace = na)=> varip float price = na varip int series_index = -1 varip int old_time = 0 varip int new_time = na varip float time_delta = 0 // ...Expand 2 linesThis function:Samples the current priceCalculates time elapsed since last updateMaintains a sequential index to track updatesThe resulting TickData structure serves as the fundamental building block for all candle generation.State Management ArchitectureThe library employs a sophisticated state management system using varip variables, which persist across executions within the same bar. This creates a hybrid programming paradigm that's different from standard Pine Script's bar-by-bar model.For chart-time candles, the core state transition logic is:Pine Script®// Real-time update of current candle candle_data := Candle.new(Open, High, Low, Close, polarity, series_index, candle_color) candles.set(0, candle_data) // When a new bar starts, preserve the previous candle if clear_state candles.insert(1, candle_data) price.clear() // Reset state for new candle Open := Close price.push(Open) series_index += 1Expand 7 linesThis pattern of updating index 0 in real-time while inserting completed candles at index 1 creates an elegant solution for maintaining both current state and historical data.Custom Timeframe ImplementationThe custom timeframe system manages its own time boundaries independent of chart bars:Pine Script®bool clear_state = switch settings.sample_type SampleType.Ticks => cumulative_series_idx >= settings.number_of_ticks SampleType.Time => cumulative_time_delta >= settings.number_of_secondsThis dual-clock system synchronizes two time domains:Pine's execution clock (bar-by-bar processing)The custom timeframe clock (tick or time-based)The library carefully handles temporal discontinuities, ensuring candle formation remains accurate despite irregular tick arrival or market gaps.Advanced Usage Techniques1. Creating Custom Indicators with Real-Time CandlesTo develop indicators that process real-time data within the current bar:Pine Script®// Get real-time candles for your data Candle[] rsi_candles = candle_array(ta.rsi(close, 14)) // Calculate indicator values based on candle properties float signal = ta.ema(rsi_candles.first().source(Source.Close), 9) // Detect patterns that occur within the bar bool divergence = close > close[1] and rsi_candles.first().Close < rsi_candles.get(1).CloseExpand 3 lines2. Working with Custom Timeframes and PlottingFor maximum flexibility when visualizing custom timeframe data:Pine Script®// Create custom timeframe candles CandleCTF[] volume_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = volume, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 60 ) // Convert specific candle properties to float arrays float[] volume_closes = volume_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) // Calculate derived values float[] volume_ema = volume_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Create custom visualization volume_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() volume_ema.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = color.orange)Expand 12 lines3. Creating Hybrid Timeframe AnalysisOne powerful application is comparing indicators across multiple timeframes:Pine Script®// Standard chart timeframe RSI float chart_rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) // Custom 5-second timeframe RSI CandleCTF[] ctf_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 5 ) float[] fast_rsi_array = ctf_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) float fast_rsi = fast_rsi_array.first() // Generate signals based on divergence between timeframes bool entry_signal = chart_rsi < 30 and fast_rsi > fast_rsi_array.get(1)Expand 10 linesFinal NotesThis library represents an advanced implementation of real-time data processing within Pine Script's constraints. By creating a reactive programming framework for handling continuous data streams, it enables sophisticated analysis typically only available in dedicated trading platforms.The design principles employed—including state management, temporal processing, and object-oriented architecture—can serve as patterns for other advanced Pine Script development beyond this specific application.------------------------Library \"real_time_candles\"A comprehensive library for creating real-time candles with customizable timeframes and sampling methods.Supports both chart-time and custom-time candles with options for candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization.Allows for tick-based or time-based sampling with moving average overlay capabilities.get_tick(source, na_replace) Captures the current price as a tick data point Parameters: source (float): Optional -

            "real_time_candles — Library by The_Peaceful_Lizard — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksPINE LIBRARYUpdated Mar 19real_time_candlesChartSource codeMore191242410 205Mar 16IntroductionThe Real-Time Candles Library provides comprehensive tools for creating, manipulating, and visualizing custom timeframe candles in Pine Script. Unlike standard indicators that only update at bar close, this library enables real-time visualization of price action and indicators within the current bar, offering traders unprecedented insight into market dynamics as they unfold.This library addresses a fundamental limitation in traditional technical analysis: the inability to see how indicators evolve between bar closes. By implementing sophisticated real-time data processing techniques, traders can now observe indicator movements, divergences, and trend changes as they develop, potentially identifying trading opportunities much earlier than with conventional approaches.Key FeaturesThe library supports two primary candle generation approaches:Chart-Time Candles: Generate real-time OHLC data for any variable (like RSI, MACD, etc.) while maintaining synchronization with chart bars.Custom Timeframe (CTF) Candles: Create candles with custom time intervals or tick counts completely independent of the chart's native timeframe.Both approaches support traditional candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization styles, with options for moving average overlays to smooth the data.Configuration RequirementsFor optimal performance with this library:Set max_bars_back = 5000 in your script settingsWhen using CTF drawing functions, set max_lines_count = 500, max_boxes_count = 500, and max_labels_count = 500These settings ensure that you will be able to draw correctly and will avoid any runtime errors.Usage ExamplesBasic Chart-Time Candle VisualizationPine Script®// Create real-time candles for RSI float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) Candle rsi_candle = candle_series(rsi, CandleType.candlestick) // Plot the candles using Pine's built-in function plotcandle(rsi_candle.Open, rsi_candle.High, rsi_candle.Low, rsi_candle.Close, \"RSI Candles\", rsi_candle.candle_color, rsi_candle.candle_color)Expand 2 linesMultiple Access PatternsThe library provides three ways to access candle data, accommodating different programming styles:Pine Script®// 1. Array-based access for collection operations Candle[] candles = candle_array(source) // 2. Object-oriented access for single entity manipulation Candle candle = candle_series(source) float value = candle.source(Source.HLC3) // 3. Tuple-based access for functional programming styles [open, high, low, close] = candle_tuple(source)Expand 4 linesCustom Timeframe ExamplesPine Script®// Create 20-second candles with EMA overlay plot_ctf_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 20, timezone = -5, tied_open = true, ema_period = 9, enable_ema = true ) // Create tick-based candles (new candle every 15 ticks) plot_ctf_tick_candles( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.heikin_ashi, number_of_ticks = 15, timezone = -5, tied_open = true )Expand 15 linesAdvanced Usage with Custom VisualizationPine Script®// Get custom timeframe candles without automatic plotting CandleCTF[] my_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 30 ) // Apply custom logic to the candles float[] ema_values = my_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Draw candles and EMA using time-based coordinates my_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() ema_values.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = #FF6D00)Expand 9 linesLibrary ComponentsData TypesCandle: Structure representing chart-time candles with OHLC, polarity, and visualization propertiesCandleCTF: Extended candle structure with additional time metadata for custom timeframesTickData: Structure for individual price updates with time deltasEnumerationsCandleType: Specifies visualization style (candlestick or Heikin-Ashi)Source: Defines price components for calculations (Open, High, Low, Close, HL2, etc.)SampleType: Sets sampling method (Time-based or Tick-based)Core Functionsget_tick(): Captures current price as a tick data pointcandle_array(): Creates an array of candles from price updatescandle_series(): Provides a single candle based on latest datacandle_tuple(): Returns OHLC values as a tuplectf_candles_array(): Creates custom timeframe candles without renderingVisualization Functionssource(): Extracts specific price components from candlescandle_ctf_to_float(): Converts candle data to float arraysctf_ema(): Calculates exponential moving averages for candle arraysdraw_ctf_candles_time(): Renders candles using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_candles_index(): Renders candles using bar index coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_time(): Renders lines using time coordinatesdraw_ctf_line_index(): Renders lines using bar index coordinatesTechnical Implementation NotesThis library leverages Pine Script's varip variables for state management, creating a sophisticated real-time data processing system. The implementation includes:Efficient tick capturing: Samples price at every execution, maintaining temporal tracking with time deltasSmart state management: Uses a hybrid approach with mutable updates at index 0 and historical preservation at index 1+Temporal synchronization: Manages two time domains (chart time and custom timeframe)The tooltip implementation provides crucial temporal context for custom timeframe visualizations, allowing users to understand exactly when each candle formed regardless of chart timeframe.LimitationsCustom timeframe candles cannot be backtested due to Pine Script's limitations with historical tick dataReal-time visualization is only available during live chart updatesMaximum history is constrained by Pine Script's array size limitsApplicationsIndicator visualization: See how RSI, MACD, or other indicators evolve in real-timeVolume analysis: Create custom volume profiles independent of chart timeframeScalping strategies: Identify short-term patterns with precisely defined time windowsVolatility measurement: Track price movement characteristics within barsCustom signal generation: Create entry/exit signals based on custom timeframe patternsConclusionThe Real-Time Candles Library bridges the gap between traditional technical analysis (based on discrete OHLC bars) and the continuous nature of market movement. By making indicators more responsive to real-time price action, it gives traders a significant edge in timing and decision-making, particularly in fast-moving markets where waiting for bar close could mean missing important opportunities.Whether you're building custom indicators, researching price patterns, or developing trading strategies, this library provides the foundation for sophisticated real-time analysis in Pine Script.Implementation Details & Advanced GuideCore Implementation ConceptsThe Real-Time Candles Library implements a sophisticated event-driven architecture within Pine Script's constraints. At its heart, the library creates what's essentially a reactive programming framework handling continuous data streams.Tick Processing SystemThe foundation of the library is the get_tick() function, which captures price updates as they occur:Pine Script®export get_tick(series float source = close, series float na_replace = na)=> varip float price = na varip int series_index = -1 varip int old_time = 0 varip int new_time = na varip float time_delta = 0 // ...Expand 2 linesThis function:Samples the current priceCalculates time elapsed since last updateMaintains a sequential index to track updatesThe resulting TickData structure serves as the fundamental building block for all candle generation.State Management ArchitectureThe library employs a sophisticated state management system using varip variables, which persist across executions within the same bar. This creates a hybrid programming paradigm that's different from standard Pine Script's bar-by-bar model.For chart-time candles, the core state transition logic is:Pine Script®// Real-time update of current candle candle_data := Candle.new(Open, High, Low, Close, polarity, series_index, candle_color) candles.set(0, candle_data) // When a new bar starts, preserve the previous candle if clear_state candles.insert(1, candle_data) price.clear() // Reset state for new candle Open := Close price.push(Open) series_index += 1Expand 7 linesThis pattern of updating index 0 in real-time while inserting completed candles at index 1 creates an elegant solution for maintaining both current state and historical data.Custom Timeframe ImplementationThe custom timeframe system manages its own time boundaries independent of chart bars:Pine Script®bool clear_state = switch settings.sample_type SampleType.Ticks => cumulative_series_idx >= settings.number_of_ticks SampleType.Time => cumulative_time_delta >= settings.number_of_secondsThis dual-clock system synchronizes two time domains:Pine's execution clock (bar-by-bar processing)The custom timeframe clock (tick or time-based)The library carefully handles temporal discontinuities, ensuring candle formation remains accurate despite irregular tick arrival or market gaps.Advanced Usage Techniques1. Creating Custom Indicators with Real-Time CandlesTo develop indicators that process real-time data within the current bar:Pine Script®// Get real-time candles for your data Candle[] rsi_candles = candle_array(ta.rsi(close, 14)) // Calculate indicator values based on candle properties float signal = ta.ema(rsi_candles.first().source(Source.Close), 9) // Detect patterns that occur within the bar bool divergence = close > close[1] and rsi_candles.first().Close < rsi_candles.get(1).CloseExpand 3 lines2. Working with Custom Timeframes and PlottingFor maximum flexibility when visualizing custom timeframe data:Pine Script®// Create custom timeframe candles CandleCTF[] volume_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = volume, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 60 ) // Convert specific candle properties to float arrays float[] volume_closes = volume_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) // Calculate derived values float[] volume_ema = volume_candles.ctf_ema(14) // Create custom visualization volume_candles.draw_ctf_candles_time() volume_ema.draw_ctf_line_time(line_color = color.orange)Expand 12 lines3. Creating Hybrid Timeframe AnalysisOne powerful application is comparing indicators across multiple timeframes:Pine Script®// Standard chart timeframe RSI float chart_rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) // Custom 5-second timeframe RSI CandleCTF[] ctf_candles = ctf_candles_array( source = close, candle_type = CandleType.candlestick, sample_type = SampleType.Time, number_of_seconds = 5 ) float[] fast_rsi_array = ctf_candles.candle_ctf_to_float(Source.Close) float fast_rsi = fast_rsi_array.first() // Generate signals based on divergence between timeframes bool entry_signal = chart_rsi < 30 and fast_rsi > fast_rsi_array.get(1)Expand 10 linesFinal NotesThis library represents an advanced implementation of real-time data processing within Pine Script's constraints. By creating a reactive programming framework for handling continuous data streams, it enables sophisticated analysis typically only available in dedicated trading platforms.The design principles employed—including state management, temporal processing, and object-oriented architecture—can serve as patterns for other advanced Pine Script development beyond this specific application.------------------------Library \"real_time_candles\"A comprehensive library for creating real-time candles with customizable timeframes and sampling methods.Supports both chart-time and custom-time candles with options for candlestick and Heikin-Ashi visualization.Allows for tick-based or time-based sampling with moving average overlay capabilities.get_tick(source, na_replace) Captures the current price as a tick data point Parameters: source (float): Optional -

            "Timezone — Library by n00btraders — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksPINE LIBRARYMar 12TimezoneChartSource codeMore46443 225Library with pre-defined timezone enums that can be used to request a timezone input from the user. The library provides a `tostring()` function to convert enum values to a valid string that can be used as a `timezone` parameter in pine script built-in functions. The library also includes a bonus function to get a formatted UTC offset from a UNIX timestamp.The timezone enums in this library were compiled by referencing the available timezone options from TradingView chart settings as well as multiple Wikipedia articles relating to lists of time zones.Some enums from this library are used to retrieve an IANA time zone identifier, while other enums only use UTC/GMT offset notation. It is important to note that the Pine Script User Manual recommends using IANA notation in most cases.HOW TO USEThis library is intended to be used by Pine Coders who wish to provide their users with a simple way to input a timezone. Using this library is as easy as 1, 2, 3:Step 1Import the library into your script. Replace <libraryVersion> with the latest available version number for this library.Pine Script®//@version=6 indicator(\"Example\") import n00btraders/Timezone/<libraryVersion> as tzStep 2Select one of the available enums from the library and use it as an input. Tip: view the library source code and scroll through the enums at the top to find the best choice for your script.Pine Script®timezoneInput = input.enum(tz.TimezoneID.EXCHANGE, \"Timezone\")Step 3Convert the user-selected input into a valid string that can be used in one of the pine script built-in functions that have a `timezone` parameter.Pine Script®string timezone = tz.tostring(timezoneInput)EXPORTED FUNCTIONSThere are multiple 𝚝𝚘𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐() functions in this library: one for each timezone enum. The function takes a single parameter: any enum field from one of the available timezone enums that are exported by this library. Depending on the selected enum, the function will return a time zone string in either UTC/GMT notation or IANA notation.Note: to avoid confusion with the built-in `str.tostring()` function, it is recommended to use this library's `tostring()` as a method rather than a function:Pine Script®string timezone = timezoneInput.tostring()offset(timestamp, format, timezone, prefix, colon) Formats the time offset from a UNIX timestamp represented in a specified timezone. Namespace types: series OffsetFormat Parameters: timestamp (int): (series int) A UNIX time. format (series OffsetFormat): (series OffsetFormat) A time offset format. timezone (string): (series string) A UTC/GMT offset or IANA time zone identifier. prefix (string): (series string) Optional 'UTC' or 'GMT' prefix for the result. colon (bool): (series bool) Optional usage of colon separator. Returns: Time zone offset using the selected format.The 𝚘𝚏𝚏𝚜𝚎𝚝() function is provided as a convenient alternative to manually using `str.format_time()` and then manipulating the result.The OffsetFormat enum is used to decide the format of the result from the `offset()` function. The library source code contains comments above this enum declaration that describe how each enum field will modify a time offset.Tip: hover over the `offset()` function call in the Pine Editor to display a pop-up containing: Function description Detailed parameter list, including default values Example function calls Example outputs for different OffsetFormat.* enum valuesNOTES At the time of this publication, Pine cannot be used to access a chart's selected time zone. Therefore, the main benefit of this library is to provide a quick and easy way to create a pine script input for a time zone (most commonly, the same time zone selected in the user's chart settings). At the time of the creation of this library, there are 95 Time Zones made available in the TradingView chart settings. If any changes are made to the time zone settings, this library will be updated to match the new changes. All time zone enums (and their individual fields) in this library were manually verified and tested to ensure correctness. An example usage of this library is included at the bottom of the source code. Credits to HoanGhetti for providing a nice Markdown resource which I referenced to be able to create a formatted informational pop-up for this library's `offset()` function.Pine libraryIn true TradingView spirit, the author has published this Pine code as an open-source library so that other Pine programmers from our community can reuse it.

'This means that in a random sample of k elements, the proportion of valid elements should closely match their proportion in the original array, with some random variation.' 'According to the central limit theorem, repeated sampling will result in an average count of valid elements following a normal distribution.' 'This supports the assumption that the valid elements are evenly spread across the array.' 'To test this hypothesis, we can conduct an experiment:' 'Create an array of 1,000,000 elements.' 'Select 1,000 random elements (1%) for validation.' 'Shuffle the array and divide it into groups of 1,000 elements.' 'If the hypothesis holds, each group should contain, on average, 1~ valid element, with minor variations.'Expand 6 lines* I'd like to attach more details to My hypothesis but it won't be very relevant here. Since this is a whole separate topic, I will leave the minimum part for understanding the engine.Practical ApplicationTo apply this hypothesis, I needed a way to generate and thoroughly mix numerous possible combinations. Within Pine, generating over 100,000 combinations presents significant challenges, and storing millions of combinations requires excessive resources.I developed an efficient mechanism that generates combinations in random order to address these limitations. While conventional methods often produce duplicates or require generating a complete list first, my approach guarantees that the first 10% of possible combinations are both unique and well-distributed. Based on my hypothesis, this sampling is sufficient to determine optimal testing parameters.Most generators and randomizers fail to accommodate both my hypothesis and Pine's constraints. My solution utilizes a simple Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for pseudo-randomization, enhanced with prime numbers to increase entropy during generation. I pre-generate the entire parameter range and then apply systematic mixing. This approach, combined with a hybrid combinatorial array-filling technique with linear distribution, delivers excellent generation quality.My engine can efficiently generate and verify 300 unique combinations per batch. Based on the above, to determine optimal values, only 10-20 Parts need to be manually scrolled through to find the appropriate value or range, eliminating the need for exhaustive testing of millions of parameter combinations.For the Score statistic I applied all the same, generated a range of Weights, distributed them randomly for each type of statistic to avoid manual distribution.Score ━ based on Trade, Profit, WinRate, Profit Factor, Drawdown, Sharpe & Sortino & Omega & Calmar Ratio.⭕️ NotesFor attentive users, a little tricks :) To save time, switch parts every 3 seconds without waiting for it to load. After 10-20 parts, stop and wait for loading. If the pause is correct, you can switch between the rest of the parts without loading, as they will be cached. This used to work without having to wait for a pause, but now it does slower. This will save a lot of time if you are going to do a deeper backtest. Sometimes you'll get the error “The scripts take too long to execute.” For a quick fix you just need to switch the TF or Ticker back and forth and most likely everything will load.The error appears because of problems on the side of the site because the engine is very heavy. It can also appear if you set too long a period for testing in BackWin or use a heavy indicator for testing. Manual Start - Allow you to Start you Result from any point. Which in turn can help you choose a good stop-stick for your real position.* It took me half a year from idea to current realization. This seems to be one of the few ways to build something automatic in backtest format and in this particular Pine environment. There are already better projects in other languages, and they are created much easier and faster because there are no limitations except for personal PC. If you see solutions to improve this system I would be glad if you share the code.

It helps traders identify key price levels where liquidity is concentrated, allowing for more informed trading decisions. ⯁ KEY FEATURES Higher Timeframe Volume Mapping Uses higher timeframe (HTF) candles to create a heatmap of volume distribution within each candle. Dynamic Volume Heatmap Colors each HTF candle background green for bullish and red for bearish, with a gradient heat overlay highlighting volume concentration. Max Volume Point Identification Marks the level within each HTF candle where the highest volume was recorded, using red for the most significant volume area. Fully Customizable Display Users can adjust the HTF timeframe, color settings, and resolution to tailor the indicator to their trading preferences. Segmented Volume Distribution Each HTF candle is divided into smaller levels, allowing traders to see volume changes within the range of each candle. Key Level Detection Max volume points often act as key support and resistance levels where price is likely to react, helping traders refine their strategies. ⯁ HOW TO USE Identify Liquidity Zones Use the max volume levels to determine areas where price is likely to find support or resistance. Assess Trend Strength Compare volume distribution between bullish and bearish HTF candles to gauge market momentum. Optimize Trade Entries & Exits Look for price reactions at high-volume areas to refine stop-loss and take-profit levels. Adjust Heatmap Resolution Customize the resolution setting to get a more detailed or broader view of volume segmentation within HTF candles. ⯁ CONCLUSION The HTF Candle Volume Thermometer is a must-have tool for traders who want to integrate volume analysis with higher timeframe structures. By visualizing volume heatmaps within each HTF candle, this indicator helps traders pinpoint critical liquidity zones and key price levels.

            "Multi Asset Similarity Matrix — Indicator by RicardoSantos — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Editors' picksOPEN-SOURCE SCRIPTUpdated Mar 17Multi Asset Similarity MatrixChartSource codeMoreAdd to favoritesAdd to favoritesUse on chart3375514 909Mar 3Provides a unique and visually stunning way to analyze the similarity between various stock market indices. This script uses a range of mathematical measures to calculate the correlation between different assets, such as indices, forex, crypto, etc..Key Features: Similarity Measures: The script offers a range of similarity measures to choose from, including SSD (Sum of Squared Differences), Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance, Chebyshev Distance, Correlation Coefficient, Cosine Similarity, Camberra Index, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Lorentzian Function, Intersection, and Penrose Shape. Asset Selection: Users can select the assets they want to analyze by entering a comma-separated list of tickers in the \"Asset List\" input field. Color Gradient: The script uses a color gradient to represent the similarity values between each pair of indices, with red indicating low similarity and blue indicating high similarity.How it Works: The script calculates the source method (Returns or Volume Modified Returns) for each index using the sec function. It then creates a matrix to hold the current values of each index over a specified window size (default is 10). For each pair of indices, it applies the selected similarity measure using the select function and stores the result in a separate matrix. The script calculates the maximum and minimum values of the similarity matrix to normalize the color gradient. Finally, it creates a table with the index names as rows and columns, displaying the similarity values for each pair of indices using the calculated colors.Visual Insights: The indicator provides an intuitive way to visualize the relationships between different assets. By analyzing the color-coded tables, traders can gain insights into: Which assets are highly correlated (blue) or uncorrelated (red) The strength and direction of these correlations Potential trading opportunities based on similarities and differences between assetsOverall, MASM is a powerful tool for market analysis and visualization, offering a unique perspective on the relationships between various assets.~llama3Mar 4Release NotesAdded asset name to the diagonal cells, optional number of digits.Mar 4Release NotesUpdate chart image.Mar 5Release NotesFixed a issue with the gradient color selection.Mar 17Release NotesFixed a issue with the correlation, thanks to: truongnldangky, scorpion1405 for noticing.Open-source scriptIn true TradingView spirit, the creator of this script has made it open-source, so that traders can review and verify its functionality.

            "What Is Tesla’s Fundamental and Technical Analysis Showing? for NASDAQ:TSLA by moomoo — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Tesla18 hours agoWhat Is Tesla’s Fundamental and Technical Analysis Showing?9Grab this chartGrab this chart11260EV maker Tesla TSLA is perhaps the most controversial stock in U.S financial markets right now. Sales appear to be slowing, while CEO Elon Musk's position as a Trump administration adviser has led political opponents to attack Tesla vehicles, dealerships and even some vehicle owners.TSLA popped 11.9% on Monday (March 24), but has generally been sinking for months. What does technical and fundamental analysis say might happen next?Let's dig in and see what we find:Tesla’s Fundamental AnalysisTSLA rose almost 95% in the roughly seven weeks between Donald Trump’s November election victory and the stock’s $488.54 all-time intraday high on Dec. 18. After all, Musk’s close ties to Trump seemed to point to good times ahead for the company.However, the stock’s price has been in decline ever since then, while vandalism of Tesla vehicles by Trump opponents has made owning or one a slightly risky affair. As of this writing, TSLA was down 32.2% year to date and 44% from the stock's Dec. 18 peak.Beyond politics, a lot of this had to do with the reality that demand for electric vehicles might have hit something of a saturation point, at least for now.There’s also been a tremendous increase in competition in recent years for electric-vehicle purchases or leases. Volkswagen VWAGY has ramped up its EV efforts, while China is absolutely full of homegrown competitors like BYD BYDDF, Nio NIO and XPeng XPEV .All in, Tesla’s vehicle sales have slackened not just in America, but also in Europe and China. But to be fair, Ford F, General Motors GM and Rivian RIVN have all hit slowdowns in EV sales as well.Still, add it all up and Wall Street is looking TSLA to report Q1 results in May that include $0.47 of adjusted earnings per share on $22.9 billion of revenue.That would represent 4.4% larger earnings and about 7.5% higher revenues when compared to last year’s Q1, where Tesla reported $0.45 of adjusted EPS on $21.3 billion in revenues.However, all 13 sell-side Tesla analysts that I can find have revised their quarterly estimates lower since current quarter began.On the bright side, the automaker’s operating and free cash flows have remained strong for the past three quarters.The firm ended 2024 with some $36.6 billion in cash against a $13.6 billion total debt load. That’s what many would consider a strong balance sheet that could sustain Tesla’s operations for a time if need be. Tesla’s Technical AnalysisA look at Tesla’s one-year chart shows that while the stock has been falling since December, it still managed to make a stand technically in recent days: The purple line at right in the above chart shows that TSLA found support twice in March very close to $212.30. That’s the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the stock’s entire April 2024 to December 2024 run.That purple line also shows indicates that Tesla has formed a small “double bottom” pattern of what could be a bullish reversal at the Fibonacci support level, and that the stock has since tried to rally from there.TSLA was also able to recently take back its 21-day Exponential Moving Average (or “EMA,” denoted by the green line above). However, the stock appears to have hit resistance at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (or “SMA,” marked above with a red line).That makes the 200-day SMA the stock's likely new pivot point.A retaking of the 200-day SMA would allow for increased target prices. Conversely, a retest and loss of Tesla’s 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level could permit a further decline.Meanwhile, Tesla’s Relative Strength Index (the gray line in the above chart’s top) has mostly improved recently and now stands in neutral territory.Similarly, the stock’s daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator -- or “MACD,” denoted by the black and gold lines and blue bars at the chart’s bottom -- is in a less-awful place than it was earlier this year.The histogram of Tesla’s 9-day Exponential Moving Average (or “EMA,” denoted by the blue bars at the chart’s bottom) is now above zero. That’s historically a short-term bullish sign.Similarly, the stock’s 12-day EMA (the black line at the bottom) is now above its 26-day EMA (the gold line). That’s typically somewhat positive, but both of those lines are still below zero -- which is historically a negative signal.(Moomoo Technologies Inc.

Tesla’s Technical AnalysisA look at Tesla’s one-year chart shows that while the stock has been falling since December, it still managed to make a stand technically in recent days: The purple line at right in the above chart shows that TSLA found support twice in March very close to $212.30. That’s the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the stock’s entire April 2024 to December 2024 run.That purple line also shows indicates that Tesla has formed a small “double bottom” pattern of what could be a bullish reversal at the Fibonacci support level, and that the stock has since tried to rally from there.TSLA was also able to recently take back its 21-day Exponential Moving Average (or “EMA,” denoted by the green line above). However, the stock appears to have hit resistance at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (or “SMA,” marked above with a red line).That makes the 200-day SMA the stock's likely new pivot point.A retaking of the 200-day SMA would allow for increased target prices. Conversely, a retest and loss of Tesla’s 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level could permit a further decline.Meanwhile, Tesla’s Relative Strength Index (the gray line in the above chart’s top) has mostly improved recently and now stands in neutral territory.Similarly, the stock’s daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator -- or “MACD,” denoted by the black and gold lines and blue bars at the chart’s bottom -- is in a less-awful place than it was earlier this year.The histogram of Tesla’s 9-day Exponential Moving Average (or “EMA,” denoted by the blue bars at the chart’s bottom) is now above zero. That’s historically a short-term bullish sign.Similarly, the stock’s 12-day EMA (the black line at the bottom) is now above its 26-day EMA (the gold line). That’s typically somewhat positive, but both of those lines are still below zero -- which is historically a negative signal.(Moomoo Technologies Inc.

Sorry if this is getting boring, but if it keeps working, why stop?It's not in a great pattern, but then again it wasn't the other 5 times, either. It has been in a downtrend since early December, but even stocks in downtrends don't have to go down in straight lines, and that's what I'm counting on here. There is some support semi-close by, too.It's a good company, and trading them in tough times (I think the last 6 weeks qualifies there, don't you?) gives me the best odds of making money. NVDA has never let me down - literally never. Sometimes it takes longer than others, but it always pays. I haven't updated my W/L record on it lately, but the 5 trades on the chart are the last 5 I've made and it was undefeated before all of them. You can go back and look at them if you desperately want to know - I know it's in at least one of those but I don't feel like going back and looking for the exact number right now. I know it's at least 100s to 0. Edit: I felt bad being lazy so I went and looked it up. It's 722-0, and that's a good enough reason for me to trade it today.So I'm long at 111.43, but I am making a little twist to my usual trade plan. I will be adding if it falls, but not using my usual methodology. It's a twist I've been working on for trading downtrending stocks. It's complicated, so I'll just update here whenever I add, and the adds will still be near the close when I make them. I will still use FPC (first profitable close) to exit any lot on the day it closes at any reasonable profit. As always - this is intended as \"edutainment\" and my perspective on what I am or would be doing, not a recommendation for you to buy or sell. Act accordingly and invest at your own risk. DYOR and only make investments that make good financial sense for you in your current situation. redwingcoachFollowBeyond Technical AnalysisSupport and ResistanceDisclaimerThe information and publications are not meant to be, and do not constitute, financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice or recommendations supplied or endorsed by TradingView.

            "NFLX & chilling until... for NASDAQ:NFLX by mommymiles — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Netflix, Inc.Editors' picksUpdated 11 hours agoNFLX & chilling until...16Grab this chartGrab this chart668452 days agoEarnings. I have been bearish on this stock technically. Currently it is floating within the Bollinger Bands. Today (3/26) was pretty bearish on the market overall. I read that NFLX will be raising rates or creating alleged value within its ad tiers. I like commercials, so I'll keep watching them lol. Anyways... I just know that people will be affected by loss of jobs/income. NFLXing may not be top of mind for many. I also hear rumors of a stock split. That would be great. & if it happens, I'll still be looking for pullbacks. Will see how week and month close. Earnings 4/17.***Side note... I remember when the original CD business launched during my college days. Oh how I wish that I was investor savy at the time. Sigh... Looking forward to earning some moolah on my trade ideas now.11 hours agoTrade active3/28 puts paid. market extremely bearish tone.mommymilesFollowMommy Miles :)nflxearningsTrend AnalysisDisclaimerThe information and publications are not meant to be, and do not constitute, financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice or recommendations supplied or endorsed by TradingView.

I still think Bitcoin will NOT stop trying to break the Heavy Resistance zone($93,300_$89,200).Bitcoin is moving near the Support zone($87,100_$85,800) and Cumulative Long Liquidation Leverage($86,376_$85,411).Regarding the Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin appears to be completing microwave C of the main wave 4. The structure of the main wave 4 is a Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5).If we look at the USDT.D%(USDT.D) chart on the 4-hour time frame, USDT.D% is pulling back to the Uptrend line and is currently in the Resistance zone(5.30%-5.15%). There is a possibility of completing the Bearish Flag Pattern.👇I expect Bitcoin to rise again in the coming hours and attack the Heavy Resistance zone($93,300_$89,200), Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ)[$90,200_$88,400], Resistance lines, Monthly Pivot Point, and 50_SMA(Daily).Note: If Bitcoin falls below $85,400, we can expect more dumps.Market Developments:GameStop announced BTC adoption as a treasury asset, signaling growing corporate interest.Trump Media partnered with Crypto to launch crypto ETFs, adding institutional momentum.Please respect each other's ideas and express them politely if you agree or disagree.Bitcoin Analyze (BTCUSDT), 1-hour time frame.Be sure to follow the updated ideas.Do not forget to put a Stop loss for your positions (For every position you want to open).Please follow your strategy and updates; this is just my Idea, and I will gladly see your ideas in this post.Please do not forget the ✅' like'✅ button 🙏😊 & Share it with your friends; thanks, and Trade safe.2 days agoTrade activeTrade was activated.20 hours agoTrade closed: stop reachedPlease pay attention to the text of the analysis.

I still think Bitcoin will NOT stop trying to break the Heavy Resistance zone($93,300_$89,200).Bitcoin is moving near the Support zone($87,100_$85,800) and Cumulative Long Liquidation Leverage($86,376_$85,411).Regarding the Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin appears to be completing microwave C of the main wave 4. The structure of the main wave 4 is a Zigzag Correction(ABC/5-3-5).If we look at the USDT.D%(USDT.D) chart on the 4-hour time frame, USDT.D% is pulling back to the Uptrend line and is currently in the Resistance zone(5.30%-5.15%). There is a possibility of completing the Bearish Flag Pattern.👇I expect Bitcoin to rise again in the coming hours and attack the Heavy Resistance zone($93,300_$89,200), Potential Reversal Zone(PRZ)[$90,200_$88,400], Resistance lines, Monthly Pivot Point, and 50_SMA(Daily).Note: If Bitcoin falls below $85,400, we can expect more dumps.Market Developments:GameStop announced BTC adoption as a treasury asset, signaling growing corporate interest.Trump Media partnered with Crypto to launch crypto ETFs, adding institutional momentum.Please respect each other's ideas and express them politely if you agree or disagree.Bitcoin Analyze (BTCUSDT), 1-hour time frame.Be sure to follow the updated ideas.Do not forget to put a Stop loss for your positions (For every position you want to open).Please follow your strategy and updates; this is just my Idea, and I will gladly see your ideas in this post.Please do not forget the ✅' like'✅ button 🙏😊 & Share it with your friends; thanks, and Trade safe.2 days agoTrade activeTrade was activated.20 hours agoTrade closed: stop reachedPlease pay attention to the text of the analysis.

            "Bitcoin - Bulls in trouble: 81k next? for BYBIT:BTCUSDT.P by TehThomas — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started BTCUSDT Perpetual ContractShort17 hours agoBitcoin - Bulls in trouble: 81k next?25Grab this chartGrab this chart3232602BTC Loses Bullish Structure – What Comes Next?Bitcoin has officially broken below the bullish trendline, closing underneath it for the first time in this recent uptrend. This is a key shift in market structure, as the ascending trendline had previously acted as strong dynamic support, keeping Bitcoin in a steady climb. Now that we have seen a clean break, the momentum appears to be shifting toward a deeper retracement, and the price is heading toward the next major support zone.Whenever a trendline like this is broken, it signals that buyers were unable to maintain control at higher levels. Instead of continuing the pattern of higher lows, Bitcoin is now moving lower, seeking stronger levels where buyers might step back in. The question now is whether the golden pocket Fibonacci retracement zone, combined with a historically strong support level, will be enough to hold the price up and trigger a reversal.Golden Pocket Support at $81.2K – A Key Bounce ZoneThe next major area of interest is the golden pocket retracement zone, which aligns perfectly with the strong support around $81.2K. This is an area where Fibonacci traders and institutional buyers tend to look for entries, as the 0.618 – 0.65 Fibonacci levels have historically been some of the most reliable support zones during retracements.What makes this level even more significant is the confluence of technical factors coming together at the same price range. Not only does this level align with the golden pocket, but it has also been a major historical support in previous price action. Every time Bitcoin has visited this range in recent weeks, we have seen strong buy-side reactions. If buyers step in once again, this could be the turning point for another leg to the upside.If we see a bounce from this zone, Bitcoin could attempt a recovery back toward $ 83K – $85K, potentially regaining its footing and re-entering a more bullish structure. However, the strength of the reaction at $81.2K will be crucial in determining whether this is just a short-term relief bounce or the start of another major uptrend.What If Bitcoin Fails to Hold $81.2K?While the golden pocket is often a high-probability reversal zone, it’s important to consider the bearish scenario as well. If Bitcoin fails to hold this level, we could be in for an even deeper retracement. The next major downside target would be around $79.3K, which lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement.A move to $79.3K would indicate that Bitcoin needs a larger correction before it can regain bullish momentum. This wouldn’t necessarily mean that the bull market is over, but it would suggest that the uptrend needs a deeper reset before resuming. A drop this low would likely shake out weak hands and allow larger players to accumulate before any potential reversal.If Bitcoin does move down to this level, the market reaction will be key. A strong bounce from $79.3K could set up a powerful recovery, but a failure to hold would raise concerns about a larger trend shift. Losing this level would open the door for even deeper downside, meaning traders would need to be cautious about the broader market outlook.Final thoughtsNow that Bitcoin has broken the trendline, all eyes are on how it interacts with this next major support zone. If the $81.2K level holds, we could see a strong reaction and a push back toward higher levels, reestablishing confidence in the market. However, if we lose this level, the next stop at $79.3K will become the last major line of defense before a more significant correction unfolds.The next few 4-hour candles will be crucial in determining whether buyers are ready to step in or if we need to prepare for a deeper move down. Will the golden pocket be enough to stop the drop, or is Bitcoin setting up for an extended retracement? We’ll find out soon!__________________________________________Thanks for your support!

            "Bitcoin - Bulls in trouble: 81k next? for BYBIT:BTCUSDT.P by TehThomas — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started BTCUSDT Perpetual ContractShort17 hours agoBitcoin - Bulls in trouble: 81k next?25Grab this chartGrab this chart3232602BTC Loses Bullish Structure – What Comes Next?Bitcoin has officially broken below the bullish trendline, closing underneath it for the first time in this recent uptrend. This is a key shift in market structure, as the ascending trendline had previously acted as strong dynamic support, keeping Bitcoin in a steady climb. Now that we have seen a clean break, the momentum appears to be shifting toward a deeper retracement, and the price is heading toward the next major support zone.Whenever a trendline like this is broken, it signals that buyers were unable to maintain control at higher levels. Instead of continuing the pattern of higher lows, Bitcoin is now moving lower, seeking stronger levels where buyers might step back in. The question now is whether the golden pocket Fibonacci retracement zone, combined with a historically strong support level, will be enough to hold the price up and trigger a reversal.Golden Pocket Support at $81.2K – A Key Bounce ZoneThe next major area of interest is the golden pocket retracement zone, which aligns perfectly with the strong support around $81.2K. This is an area where Fibonacci traders and institutional buyers tend to look for entries, as the 0.618 – 0.65 Fibonacci levels have historically been some of the most reliable support zones during retracements.What makes this level even more significant is the confluence of technical factors coming together at the same price range. Not only does this level align with the golden pocket, but it has also been a major historical support in previous price action. Every time Bitcoin has visited this range in recent weeks, we have seen strong buy-side reactions. If buyers step in once again, this could be the turning point for another leg to the upside.If we see a bounce from this zone, Bitcoin could attempt a recovery back toward $ 83K – $85K, potentially regaining its footing and re-entering a more bullish structure. However, the strength of the reaction at $81.2K will be crucial in determining whether this is just a short-term relief bounce or the start of another major uptrend.What If Bitcoin Fails to Hold $81.2K?While the golden pocket is often a high-probability reversal zone, it’s important to consider the bearish scenario as well. If Bitcoin fails to hold this level, we could be in for an even deeper retracement. The next major downside target would be around $79.3K, which lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement.A move to $79.3K would indicate that Bitcoin needs a larger correction before it can regain bullish momentum. This wouldn’t necessarily mean that the bull market is over, but it would suggest that the uptrend needs a deeper reset before resuming. A drop this low would likely shake out weak hands and allow larger players to accumulate before any potential reversal.If Bitcoin does move down to this level, the market reaction will be key. A strong bounce from $79.3K could set up a powerful recovery, but a failure to hold would raise concerns about a larger trend shift. Losing this level would open the door for even deeper downside, meaning traders would need to be cautious about the broader market outlook.Final thoughtsNow that Bitcoin has broken the trendline, all eyes are on how it interacts with this next major support zone. If the $81.2K level holds, we could see a strong reaction and a push back toward higher levels, reestablishing confidence in the market. However, if we lose this level, the next stop at $79.3K will become the last major line of defense before a more significant correction unfolds.The next few 4-hour candles will be crucial in determining whether buyers are ready to step in or if we need to prepare for a deeper move down. Will the golden pocket be enough to stop the drop, or is Bitcoin setting up for an extended retracement? We’ll find out soon!__________________________________________Thanks for your support!

Sell Your Altcoins, They Will Go To Zero!16Grab this chartGrab this chart27271 244Hello, Skyrexians!We had some doubts in this scenario, but now price action clarified it. BTC.D has finally decided to pump in the wave 5 and this wave can be even extended. Altcoins Will lose 70% of their value and never pump after that to cover your losses.Let's take a look at the daily chart. We have already shown you this Elliott waves picture.

With the prevailing bullish momentum, the market may continue to rise towards the next resistance levels or move sideways untile next week. If a pullback occurs, it may provide an opportunity to go long from the previous resistance zone that has now become support.

(READ THE CAPTION)68Grab this chartGrab this chart24241 5122 days agoBy examining the gold chart on the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that, as expected, the price continued its bullish movement and climbed close to its all-time high of $3057, reaching $3056 today. Since this level acted as a Bearish Rejection Block, we’re now seeing a price correction from that area, with gold currently trading around $3049. If the price stabilizes below the $3050 mark, we may see further downside. Potential bearish targets are $3045, $3040, and $3035, respectively.Please support me with your likes and comments to motivate me to share more analysis with you and share your opinion about the possible trend of this chart with me !Best Regards , Arman Shaban20 hours agoTrade activeBy analyzing the gold chart on the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that the price dropped exactly as expected, hitting all three targets at $3045, $3040, and $3035, delivering over 150 pips in profit!

The highlighted zone, which is a strong resistance, coincides with the 0.618 - 0.65 Fibonacci retracement levels, which are often key areas for price reversals. Additionally, the rising wedge formation signals a potential loss of bullish momentum, typically a bearish continuation or reversal pattern. The price has made several attempts to push higher, but the presence of multiple confluences, including the resistance levels around $70.50, suggests that the bullish rally might be facing exhaustion. If a reversal occurs from this zone, it could lead to a significant drop, potentially targeting the $66.50 region or even lower, aligning with previous structural supports and liquidity zones. Traders should monitor for bearish confirmations, such as a strong rejection candle, a break of the rising wedge structure, or increased selling volume. Key levels to watch: - Resistance Zone: $70.50 - $71.00 (Fib 0.618-0.65 and strong resistance) - Support Targets: $68.00 and $66.50 This setup requires patience and confirmation before taking action.

Red boxes again played their part giving us precise entry and exit level activating and hitting their own targets, the best of which gave us over 300pips on the capture.Now, end of week, we have support below 3075 and resistance on the fight for the close 3090. Too high to attempt the long, in the middle to attempt the short. So we'll wait and see how the market closes and come back on Sunday with the KOG Report and our view for the week ahead.Wishing you all a great weekend.As always, trade safe.This weeks targets completed:KOG’s bias for the week:Bearish below 3040 with targets below 3010✅, 3006✅, 2997, 2985 and below that 2978Bullish on break of 3040 with targets above 3050✅, 3055✅, 3063✅ and above that 3067✅RED BOXES:Break above 3037 for 3040✅, 3047✅, 3050✅, 3055✅, 3063✅ and 3066✅ in extension of the moveBreak below 3010 for 3006, 3000, 2997, 2990 and 2985 in extension of the moveKnightsofGoldFollow🔵 FREE TELEGRAM CHANNEL: t.me/KnightsofGold 🔴 TWITTER: twitter.com/knightsofgold2🟢 INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/knights_of_gold/🟡 Disclaimer: Not financial advice.

At the beginning of the chart, the price started to grow from the buyer zone between 2865–2880 points, entering the first upward channel, where it formed higher highs and higher lows. After multiple rejections from the resistance line, the price made a correction and exited the channel, but the overall bullish impulse remained intact. Following a brief consolidation in the support area between 3000–3015 points, GOLD launched another strong move upward, securing a position above the current support level at 3000. This zone has proven to be strong support and marked the beginning of a new upward channel. Currently, the price is trading confidently inside this second upward channel. After a minor correction to the midline, GOLD continued its upward trajectory. I expect a short-term pullback, but as long as the support holds, the bullish trend is likely to continue. My main scenario assumes that GOLD will stay within the channel and move toward TP1, which is set at 3135 points. Given the bullish structure, solid reaction from support, and clear upward momentum, I remain bullish and anticipate further growth.

Given this, there is potential for a bearish reaction if price action confirms rejection, such as a bearish engulfing candle, long upper wicks or increased selling volume.If the resistance level holds, I anticipate a downward move toward 161.20, which represents a logical target based on previous price behavior and market structure.However, if the price breaks above this zone and sustains above it, the bearish outlook may be invalidated, opening the door for further upside.Just my take on support and resistance zones—not financial advice.

            "The Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong? for FX:EURUSD by TradingView — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Euro / U.S. DollarEditors' picks2 days agoThe Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong?397Grab this chartGrab this chart17178 991If your trendlines look like a toddler took a crayon to your chart, we need to talk. Or if you draw them so much that your chart looks like a spider web, we still need to talk. Trendlines are one of the most abused, misinterpreted, and downright misused tools in technical analysis. Used correctly, they can give you a structured view of market direction, potential reversals, and areas of interest. Used incorrectly? Well, they can be your fast lane to bad trades, broken accounts, and questioning your life choices.So, are you drawing them wrong? Let’s find out.📞 A Trendline Is Not Your Emotional Support LineThis is big because it happens virtually every day across the charts. When a trade is going south, it’s tempting to adjust your trendline just to make your setup look valid again. That’s not technical analysis—that’s denial. A proper trendline should connect clear pivot highs or lows, not be forcefully manipulated to fit a bias.Traders do this all the time. Price action no longer respects their original line, so they just… move it. As if shifting the goalposts somehow changes reality. It doesn’t. If your trendline gets broken, respect the price action and get out, don’t adjust the line because you risk dragging your account deeper in losses.🤝 Two Points Make a Line—But Three Make It RealHere’s where most traders mess up. They draw a trendline the moment they see two points connecting. Sure, two points technically make a line, but two random highs or lows do not make a valid trend.A legitimate trendline should be tested at least three times to confirm that price actually respects it. Until then, it’s just a hopeful hypothesis. But we gotta give it to the early spotters — yes, if you see two points, pop open a trade and it pans out nicely, then you’ve chomped down on the good grass before the other animals. The more times price touches and respects the trendline, the stronger it is but the risk of it getting overcrowded increases. Anything less than three touches? You’re basically trading off a hunch with a potentially higher risk-reward ratio.⚔️ Wicks, Bodies, or Both? The Great DebateShould you draw trendlines through candle wicks or just use the bodies of the candlesticks? If you’ve spent any time in trading communities, you’ve probably seen this debate get heated enough to break friendships.Here’s the deal:If you’re trading short-term price action, drawing trendlines using candle bodies makes sense because it reflects where most of the market agreed on price.If you’re looking at major trends, wicks matter because they show extreme liquidity zones where prices actually reached before snapping back.⛑️ Steep Trendlines Are a Disaster Waiting to HappenIf your trendline looks more like a vertical cliff than an actual slope, you might want to reconsider its validity. The steeper the trendline, the less reliable it is.A proper trendline should represent a natural flow of zigging and zagging price action. If it’s moving up too aggressively, it’s usually unsustainable. That’s why parabolic runs tend to end with painful crashes—what goes up too fast typically comes down even faster.If your trendline is forming an angle sharper than 45 degrees, be careful. Sustainable trends don’t need a rocket launch trajectory to prove their strength.🌊 One Chart, One Trendline (or Two)—Not TenSome traders draw so many trendlines that their charts get lost under the weight of too many lines. If you need to squint to see price action through the mess of lines, you’re doing too much.Here’s a golden rule in drawing trendlines: less is more. Trendlines should highlight key structures, not overwhelm you with information. If you find yourself drawing trendlines at every minor high and low, take a step back. A clean chart is a tradable chart and one or two trendlines are usually enough to help uncover price direction.🚩 Breakouts Aren’t Always BreakoutsOne of the biggest mistakes traders make is assuming that when the price breaks a trendline, it’s an instant reversal signal. It’s not.Markets (or well-trained algos) love to fake out emotional traders. Just because price dips below your uptrend line doesn’t mean the trend is over—it could just be a temporary pullback or liquidity grab (stop-loss hunting?) before continuing in the original direction.Always wait for confirmation. A proper breakout should come with:Increased volume (to validate the move)Retest of the broken trendline (flipping from support to resistance, or vice versa)Clear follow-through (not just a single candle wick that breaks and snaps back)The market loves tricking traders into premature entries or exits. Don’t fall for it—instead, use some technical backup like looking for a double top, a head and shoulders or some other popular chart pattern.☝️ The Only Trendline That Matters? The One The Market RespectsAt the end of the day, trendlines are just tools—guides to help you structure price action. They’re not magical indicators. They don’t necessarily predict the future. They simply help visualize market tendencies.If price constantly breaks through your trendline and ignores it, guess what? It’s not a valid trendline. The best traders don’t force a narrative—they adjust their view based on what the price is actually doing.So next time you find yourself drawing, adjusting, or forcing trendlines into existence, ask yourself: Am I analyzing the market, or just trying to make myself feel better? Because the market isn’t wrong—so better check your trendlines twice.Now off to you—are you using trendlines in your charts and do you wait for the third point to connect before moving in?

            "The Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong? for FX:EURUSD by TradingView — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Euro / U.S. DollarEditors' picks2 days agoThe Truth About Trendlines: Are You Drawing Them Wrong?397Grab this chartGrab this chart17178 991If your trendlines look like a toddler took a crayon to your chart, we need to talk. Or if you draw them so much that your chart looks like a spider web, we still need to talk. Trendlines are one of the most abused, misinterpreted, and downright misused tools in technical analysis. Used correctly, they can give you a structured view of market direction, potential reversals, and areas of interest. Used incorrectly? Well, they can be your fast lane to bad trades, broken accounts, and questioning your life choices.So, are you drawing them wrong? Let’s find out.📞 A Trendline Is Not Your Emotional Support LineThis is big because it happens virtually every day across the charts. When a trade is going south, it’s tempting to adjust your trendline just to make your setup look valid again. That’s not technical analysis—that’s denial. A proper trendline should connect clear pivot highs or lows, not be forcefully manipulated to fit a bias.Traders do this all the time. Price action no longer respects their original line, so they just… move it. As if shifting the goalposts somehow changes reality. It doesn’t. If your trendline gets broken, respect the price action and get out, don’t adjust the line because you risk dragging your account deeper in losses.🤝 Two Points Make a Line—But Three Make It RealHere’s where most traders mess up. They draw a trendline the moment they see two points connecting. Sure, two points technically make a line, but two random highs or lows do not make a valid trend.A legitimate trendline should be tested at least three times to confirm that price actually respects it. Until then, it’s just a hopeful hypothesis. But we gotta give it to the early spotters — yes, if you see two points, pop open a trade and it pans out nicely, then you’ve chomped down on the good grass before the other animals. The more times price touches and respects the trendline, the stronger it is but the risk of it getting overcrowded increases. Anything less than three touches? You’re basically trading off a hunch with a potentially higher risk-reward ratio.⚔️ Wicks, Bodies, or Both? The Great DebateShould you draw trendlines through candle wicks or just use the bodies of the candlesticks? If you’ve spent any time in trading communities, you’ve probably seen this debate get heated enough to break friendships.Here’s the deal:If you’re trading short-term price action, drawing trendlines using candle bodies makes sense because it reflects where most of the market agreed on price.If you’re looking at major trends, wicks matter because they show extreme liquidity zones where prices actually reached before snapping back.⛑️ Steep Trendlines Are a Disaster Waiting to HappenIf your trendline looks more like a vertical cliff than an actual slope, you might want to reconsider its validity. The steeper the trendline, the less reliable it is.A proper trendline should represent a natural flow of zigging and zagging price action. If it’s moving up too aggressively, it’s usually unsustainable. That’s why parabolic runs tend to end with painful crashes—what goes up too fast typically comes down even faster.If your trendline is forming an angle sharper than 45 degrees, be careful. Sustainable trends don’t need a rocket launch trajectory to prove their strength.🌊 One Chart, One Trendline (or Two)—Not TenSome traders draw so many trendlines that their charts get lost under the weight of too many lines. If you need to squint to see price action through the mess of lines, you’re doing too much.Here’s a golden rule in drawing trendlines: less is more. Trendlines should highlight key structures, not overwhelm you with information. If you find yourself drawing trendlines at every minor high and low, take a step back. A clean chart is a tradable chart and one or two trendlines are usually enough to help uncover price direction.🚩 Breakouts Aren’t Always BreakoutsOne of the biggest mistakes traders make is assuming that when the price breaks a trendline, it’s an instant reversal signal. It’s not.Markets (or well-trained algos) love to fake out emotional traders. Just because price dips below your uptrend line doesn’t mean the trend is over—it could just be a temporary pullback or liquidity grab (stop-loss hunting?) before continuing in the original direction.Always wait for confirmation. A proper breakout should come with:Increased volume (to validate the move)Retest of the broken trendline (flipping from support to resistance, or vice versa)Clear follow-through (not just a single candle wick that breaks and snaps back)The market loves tricking traders into premature entries or exits. Don’t fall for it—instead, use some technical backup like looking for a double top, a head and shoulders or some other popular chart pattern.☝️ The Only Trendline That Matters? The One The Market RespectsAt the end of the day, trendlines are just tools—guides to help you structure price action. They’re not magical indicators. They don’t necessarily predict the future. They simply help visualize market tendencies.If price constantly breaks through your trendline and ignores it, guess what? It’s not a valid trendline. The best traders don’t force a narrative—they adjust their view based on what the price is actually doing.So next time you find yourself drawing, adjusting, or forcing trendlines into existence, ask yourself: Am I analyzing the market, or just trying to make myself feel better? Because the market isn’t wrong—so better check your trendlines twice.Now off to you—are you using trendlines in your charts and do you wait for the third point to connect before moving in?

            "EUR/USD analysis – two Key Scenarios for OANDA:EURUSD by melikatrader94 — TradingView Search Products Community Markets Brokers More EN Get started Euro / U.S. DollarShortUpdated 2 days agoEUR/USD analysis – two Key Scenarios45Grab this chartGrab this chart14141 563Mar 10hello guys.The EUR/USD pair has witnessed a strong bullish surge, breaking through key resistance levels. However, two possible scenarios emerge from this critical point:🔴 First Scenario (Bullish Continuation):Price could retrace to the 1.07-1.072 demand zone before resuming its upward trajectory.If support holds, the pair may climb towards the 1.10-1.105 resistance zone, aligning with the upper boundary of the ascending channel.🔵 Second Scenario (Bearish Reversal):If bullish momentum fades, a deeper correction may follow, breaking below the key support zone.This could lead the price toward the 1.04-1.043 area, marking a retest of previous lows and reinforcing bearish sentiment.-------------------Conclusion:The current level serves as a critical decision point. If price sustains above support ($1.072-$1.068), bullish momentum may continue. However, a break below could signal a bearish correction, shifting market sentiment. Traders should watch key levels for confirmation of either scenario.2 days agoTrade closed: target reachedreact to the top line of the channel complete!I think the dark blue scenario is more probable!melikatrader94Follow👉 My recommended exchange(you can get up to $5050 bonuses): lbank.one/join/uF7u10M____👉 My recommended broker: bit.ly/HYMCMELI____Telegram: t.me/melikatrader94Forex: t.me/melikatrader94GoldForexAlso on:Beyond Technical AnalysisChart PatternseuroEURUSDForexforexpairforexpairsforexsignalTrend AnalysisUSDRelated publicationsGold Price Analysis: Short-Term Pullback Before Resuming Uptrendby melikatrader94Gold (XAU/USD) Bearish Setupby melikatrader94BTC/USDT Technical Analysis – Bearish Outlookby melikatrader94DisclaimerThe information and publications are not meant to be, and do not constitute, financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice or recommendations supplied or endorsed by TradingView.

However, two possible scenarios emerge from this critical point:🔴 First Scenario (Bullish Continuation):Price could retrace to the 1.07-1.072 demand zone before resuming its upward trajectory.If support holds, the pair may climb towards the 1.10-1.105 resistance zone, aligning with the upper boundary of the ascending channel.🔵 Second Scenario (Bearish Reversal):If bullish momentum fades, a deeper correction may follow, breaking below the key support zone.This could lead the price toward the 1.04-1.043 area, marking a retest of previous lows and reinforcing bearish sentiment.-------------------Conclusion:The current level serves as a critical decision point. If price sustains above support ($1.072-$1.068), bullish momentum may continue. However, a break below could signal a bearish correction, shifting market sentiment.

After analyzing this chart, we can see that the price spent some time within a consolidation range. During this period, the price tested the lower support zone and made a strong reaction from this level, moving upwards. This move showed strong buying pressure as the price quickly reversed from the support zone, signaling that buyers were ready to push higher. The price then broke above the trend line, continuing to rise and establishing a bullish momentum. It reached the upper resistance zone before encountering resistance and starting to consolidate. This consolidation happened within a narrow range, confirming that the market was unsure about the next move but still held above the important support 1. Now, the price is trading near the trend line and is testing the support zone. A reaction from this support will be crucial for determining the next move.
